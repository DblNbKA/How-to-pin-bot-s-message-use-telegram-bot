This part of the code that allows the bot to pin its message for itself and the user of the telegram bot in python

Code parsing:

import telebot - i think you know what it is for

bot = telebot.TeleBot('Your telegram bot token') - instead of "Your telegram bot token" you insert the token that @BotFather gave you

@bot.message_handler(commands=['start']) - the bot will respond to the /start command

def pin(message): - function
    bot.send_message(message.chat.id, 'Your text with a greeting, explanation, or something similar, depending on what you need') - sending message by bot
    pinn = bot.send_message(message.chat.id, 'The message you want to pin').message_id - sending the message you want to pin and saving its ID with .message_id
    bot.pin_chat_message(message.chat.id, message_id = pinn) - pinning a message
